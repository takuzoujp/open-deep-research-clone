An open-source alternative to Gemini Deep Research, built to generate AI-powered reports from web search results with precision and efficiency.

This app functions in three key steps:

1. **Search Results Retrieval**: Using the Bing Search API, the app fetches comprehensive search results for the specified search term.
2. **Content Extraction**: Leveraging JinaAI, it retrieves and processes the contents of the selected search results, ensuring accurate and relevant information.
3. **Report Generation**: With the curated search results and extracted content, the app generates a detailed report tailored to your custom prompts, providing insightful and synthesized output.

Open Deep Research combines powerful tools to streamline research and report creation in a user-friendly, open-source platform. You can customize the app to your needs (change the model, prompt, update rate limits and number of results both fetched and selected etc.)
